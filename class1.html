      <aside class="notes">So HTML started out in the early days of the internet, and has gone through a few versions. We're going to using the HTML5 syntax, which is to say the HTML5 way of writing and structuring our pages. The TL;DR is that HTML has evolved over time, and will probably evolve even further. </aside>

    <!-- Folder Structure -->
    <section>
      <h3>Get Started: Folder Structure</h3>
      <p>All the files for your site should be stored within the same folder.</p>

      <div class="halfblock">
      <p class="left-align"><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML Files</li>
        <li>CSS Files</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Script files</li>
        <li>Anything else that will appear on your site</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="left-align" style="margin-top: .5em;"><small>Note: File names should not include spaces or special characters. File names ARE case sensitive.</small></p>
      </div>
      <div class="halfblock">
        <img src="img/folderstructure1.png" alt="Diagram showing html-site folder with sub-folder for images, index.html, and styles.css" />
      </div>
      <aside class="notes">Next, let's take a few minutes to get our file structure set up. Like many things, web development is easier when you're organized. Let's go ahead and create a new folder for your site to live in. Call it something like "GDI Site", "Intro to HTML", etc. 

      Then, inside of that file (I'll also use the term directory), create another file called "images" or "img". 

      Then, open up your text editor of choice and create a file called "index.html". All you have to do this is open up a tab, and name the file "index.html" Save the index file to your GDI Site folder. 

      Then, let's use the text editor to create another file called "styles.css", the same way you created your "index.html" file. Just add that ".css" on the end. Save that inside the GDI Site folder too. 

      Cool, now that we're all set up, let's talk about where we're headed.

      <img src="img/sample-page.png" alt="Screenshot of a sample page"/>
      <p>By the end of the class, you will have built a simple site using HTML and CSS on a topic of your choice. <a href="sample-code/final/index.html" target="_blank">Here is one about rock climbing.</a>
      <aside class="notes">So we're going to build a site with images, headers, text, links, and lists. It might look a little like this? It might not! You can make your site about whatever you want.</aside>

      <h3>Anatomy of a website</h3>
      <p><strong>Your Content</strong><br />
      <strong>+ HTML</strong>: Structure<br />
      <strong>+ CSS</strong>: Presentation<br />
      <strong>= Your Website</strong></p>
      <p>A website is a way to present your content to the world, using HTML and CSS to present that content &amp; make it look good.</p>
      <aside class="notes">So in your website, HTML provides the structure, CSS makes it look good & comprehensive. Together they make up your website. </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Anatomy of a website</h3>
      <p>Concrete example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A paragraph is your <strong>content</strong></li>
        <li>Putting your content into an HTML tag to make it look like a paragraph is <strong>structure</strong>
<pre><code class ="html">&lt;p&gt;A paragraph is your content&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Making the font of your paragraph green and 24px is <strong>presentation</strong><br />
        <p style="font-size:24px; color:green;">A paragraph is your content</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- HTML element-->
    <section>
      <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Element</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An individual component of HTML</li>
            <li>Paragraph, heading, table, list, div, link, image, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tag</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Marks the beginning &amp; end of an element</li>
            <li>Opening tag and Closing Tag</li>
            <li>Tags contain characters that indicate the tag's purpose
<pre><code class ="html">&lt;tagname&gt;Stuff in the middle&lt;/tagname&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
<pre><code class ="html">&lt;p&gt; This is a sample paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">An element is an individual unit or component of HTML. The tag marks the start & end of an element, basically saying "Hey! This thing right here? That's a paragraph!" or "Hey, image is here!"</aside>

      <h3>Tag Breakdown</h3>
      <img src="img/tagbreakdown.png" alt="Tag breakdown" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" />
      <aside class="notes">Here's the breakdown of an HTML tag. I'm going to go ahead and get this out there...more than once today, I will forget to close a tag. It happens! So if you find yourself with something that isn't working, first step is to check for typos, second step is to make sure you've closed your tags. </aside>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Container Element</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An element that can contain other elements or
        content</li>
            <li>A paragraph (&lt;p>) contains text</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Stand Alone Element</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>An element that cannot contain anything else</li>
            <li>
<pre><code class = "html">&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;img/&gt;
</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">Container elements can, surprise, contain things! Like text in a paragraph. Standalone elements can't contain anything else. Break can only be a break, image is only an image. </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Attribute</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Provides additional information about the HTML element</li>
            <li>Class, ID, language, style, identity, source</li>
            <li>Placed inside an opening tag, before the right angle bracket.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Value</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Value is the value assigned to a given attribute.</li>
            <li>Values must be contained inside quotation marks.</li>
            <li>
<pre><code class ="html">&lt;div id="copyright"&gt;&copy;Girl Develop It logo 2016&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src="my_picture.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://girldevelopit.com"&gt;Girl Develop It&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">So elements can have attributes, and those attributes give you additional information about the element, such as its class, identity, source, etc. You put attributes inside the opening tag, but before the right angle "greater than" bracket. 

      And value is what is being assigned to a given attribute. These must live inside of quotation marks. Missing quotation marks is another easy to make mistake! </aside>

    <!-- HTML Page-->
    <section>
      <h3>Doctype</h3>
      <p>The first thing on an HTML page is the doctype, which tells the browser which version of the markup language the page is using.</p>
<pre><code class = "html">&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://
www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class = "html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p><small>* The doctype is case-insensitive. <br/>DOCtype, doctype, DocType and DoCtYpe are all valid.</small></p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>HTML Tag</h3>
      <p>After &lt;doctype&gt;, the page content must be contained between &lt;html&gt; tags.</p>
<pre><code class = "html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<aside class="notes">Ok, this looks a bit wild, but fear not. In order for a browser to know that the file you're serving it is indeed HTML and not a plate of spaghetti, you've got to make this declaration and proudly annouce that it's HTML. All you need is the doctype html, not the rest of the noise. </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Head and Body Tags</h3>
      <p><strong>Head:</strong> The head contains the title of the page &amp; meta information about the page. Meta information is not visible to the user, but has many purposes, like providing information to search engines.</p>
      <p><strong>Body:</strong> The body contains the actual content of the page. Everything that is contained in the body is visible to the user.</p>
      <aside class="notes">OK, now that we've told the server that this file is HTML, we're done right? But what's this html tag noise? OK, so, there are occasions where you may have other types of code on a page, such as JavaScript, and those get their own tags, such as "script". When we use the HTML tags, we're saying that everything bound in between them is HTML. They're like the big wrapper over our whole work today. </aside>
    </section>

    <!--example of head and body tags-->
    <section>
      <h3>Head and Body Tags: Example</h3>
      <img src="img/example-headbody.png" alt="example of head and body" />
      <aside class="notes">Wait, what? Head and body? So there's a bit of magic that happens between the browser and your HTML. The header is part of that magic. The header tells the browser a lot of valuable information, such as the page's title, and also provides data to search engines. Links to other files also live in the header. But here's the thing. No one will ever know it's there. It just hums away, doing its thing. 

The body is where the public stuff goes. Anything you put inside the body is visible to the user. This is where your paragraphs, your imgages, everything, goes. </aside>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Head and Body Tags</h3>
<pre><code class = "html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title of the page &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    The page content here.
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

    <!-- Develop it -->
    <section>
      <h3>Let's develop it!</h3>
      <p>Let's get our web page set up with a doctype, head, title and body.</p>
      <p>Later we'll add some content.</p>
      <aside class="notes">OK, we've covered a lot. So let's practice. Let's crack open that index.html file. We're going to take a few mintes, and I want you to add the doctype declaration, the head tags, title tags & title, and the body tags. Don't worry about content, just get the scaffolding in place to build upon. Remember to check your spelling, and close those tags! Give it a shot, and the TA's will be around to help.</aside>
    </section>

    <!-- Nesting-->
    <section>
      <h3>Nesting ü•öü¶Ü</h3>
      <p>All elements "nest" inside one another</p>
      <p>Nesting is what happens when you put other containing tags inside other containing tags. For example, you would put the &lt;p&gt; inside of the &lt;body&gt; tags. The &lt;p&gt; is now nested inside the &lt;body&gt;</p>
      <aside class="notes">Nesting is when you put containing tags inside other containing tags. For example putting paragraphs inside the body. Nesting helps group elements together, and can help you when you're deciding how they should look or behave.</aside>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Nesting Order</h3>
      <img src = "img/owls.jpg" alt="Nesting owl dolls"/>

      <h3>Nesting: Example</h3>
      <p>Elements are 'nested' inside the &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>

This isn't english class, we're not going to judge you on the length of your paragraph. P's can be just one word, or thousands of words. An important note: regardless of how you write paragraphs in your file, they come out the same. Whitespace is for humans, and it's important!</aside>

&lt;h5&gt;Heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;

        <h1 style = "font-size: 120%">Heading 1</h1>

    </div>
    <aside class="notes">So, the h tag, or heading. H tags go from h1 to h6, with descending order, meaning h1 is bigger than h2, etc. It's important to note that you should use heading size to indicate importance, rather than for style. We can style them with CSS later. Think of h1 as a headline, h2s as a subheader, h3's as a subhead to a subhead, etc. Most times, you don't get beyond h3, or h4.</aside>

    <!-- Links-->
    <section>
      <h3>Element: Link</h3>
      <p>Links have three components</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tag: &lt;a>&lt;/a></li>
        <li>Href attribute: "http://www.girldevelopit.com"</li>
        <li>Title attribute: "Girl Develop It"</li>
      </ul>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com" title="Girl Develop It"&gt;Girl Develop It&lt;/a&gt;<
</code></pre>
      <p><a href ="http://www.girldevelopit.com" title="Girl Develop It">Girl Develop It</a></p>
      <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag surrounds text or images to turn them into links</p>
      <aside class="notes">Ok, now that we've got content, we've got some structure, let's talk about going places with links. Links are a little tricky because they need a few things. They need the "a" or "anchor" tag to kick it off. They also need a HREF, or the actual meat of the link, and they need a title attribute. The A tag surrounds text or images to turn them in to links, but the href tells you where its going. Using Title is also good for people who navigate the internet with screen readers or other assistive technologies.</aside>
    </section>

    <!-- Link Attributes -->
    <section>
      <h3>Link Attributes</h3>
      <p>Links can have attributes that tell the link to do different actions like open in a new tab, or launch your e-mail program.</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a href="home.html" target="_blank"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p><small>Link opens in a new window/tab with <strong>target="_blank"</strong></small></p>
      <!-- Change email to fit your chapter's needs-->
<pre><code class="html">&lt;a href="mailto:sponsorships@girldevelopit.com"&gt;E-mail us!&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p><small>Adding <strong>mailto:</strong> directly before the email address means the link will open in the default email program.</small></p>
      <aside class="notes">Links can also do things like launch an email application, or open themselves in a new tab. Using target="_blank" will open a link in a new tag. putting "mailto:" before an email address will automatically pop open the default email program. So, you see the text of "Email us!" after the close of the mailto attribute? That's what will appear as a link text, generally it'll have an underline. That's where you can get creative and make a user's experience of navigating your content easier. Those linkage words give people an idea of what that link is going to do and where it is going to take them.</aside>
    </section>

    <!-- relative & absolute links -->
    <section>
      <h3>Relative vs. Absolute paths for links &amp; images</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Relative</strong><br />
        Relative paths change depending upon the page the link is on.
        <ul>
          <li><small>Links within the same directory need no path information. <code>"filename.jpg"</code></small></li>
          <li><small>Subdirectories are listed without preceding slashes. <code>"img/filename.jpg"</code></small></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Absolute</strong><br />
        <ul>
          <li>Absolute paths refer to a specific location of a file, including the domain. <small><code>"http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/detroit"</code></small></li>
          <li>Typically used when pointing to a link that is not within your own domain.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="notes">There are two types of links, relative, and absolute. This is a bit of a tough concept to explain, so i'm going to share some links to some explainers in case you'd like a different explainer. So the basics: relative links are relative to the page they appear on. Relative links usually are linking to another page or file within your site. So for instance, remember our file structure? Both the folder "images" and the "index.html" file are in the same overarching folder of "GDI HTML" If you had a file within that images folder that you wanted to link to on your site, you'd need to link to it at img/picture.jpg. If they were at the same level, say you had no images folder, you'd just link to "picture.jpg". 

      Absolute paths refer to a specific file or site, including its domain. TYpically this is if you wanted to link elsewhere, like to your facebook page, or your twitter account. </aside>

    <!--Images-->
    <section>
      <h3>Element: Image</h3>
      <p>Images have three components</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tag: &lt;img /&gt;</li>
        <li>Src attribute: "https://assets.brandfolder.com/4btx26fz/original/circle-gdi-logo.png"</li>
        <li>Alt attribute: "Girl Develop It logo"</li>
      </ul>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;img src="https://assets.brandfolder.com/4btx26fz/original/circle-gdi-logo.png"
alt="Girl Develop It logo"/&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p><small>* Notice: This tag is our first example of a stand-alone or "self-closing" element.</small></p>
      <aside class="notes">Alright, we've gotten links going, now let's talk about pictures! 
        To add an image to your page, you use the tag img. IMG is self closing, our first tag like that so far. It has an attribute called "src" or source. Basically, the image tag is asking, "cool, where's your picture located? What's it's source. Now you can link to an image somewhere on the internet, like in this example, or you can use a relative link to something that's already in your images folder, where this would look like "img/logo.jpg".

        Images also have an attribute caled "alt", also refered to as "alt text". Again this is very important to users who access your page with screen readers or other assistive devices, as those devices will see that alt text and announce it to the user. So someone who is blind would hear a description "Girl Develop It logo", as long as we apply alt text to it. Be careful not to be too verbose in your alt text, but you want to also be sufficiently descriptive. It's a fine balance.

    <aside class="notes">Lists come in two flavors, unordered and ordered. Unordered show up as bullets by default (this can be changed), and ordered will display a 1, 2, 3 etc by defualt. You don't have to add the numbers, HTML does that for you, so put them in the sequence you'd like them to be in. 

    To make an unordered list you use the tag "ul". Each item within that list is a "li" for list item. Ordered lists use "ol" for ordered list, and also have "li" inside them. Just as a heads up, li's cannot exist outside of a UL or an OL, they're dependent upon being one of those two things. </aside>
